hi, i'm katie. i'm a chicago-based designer that sometimes likes to code random stuff :)

sometimes i just need to build something, and vscode is free, so....

currently, i'm switching between a few projects, mostly to get some practice in before i start university this fall â™¡

a few that i'm working on right now include:

- my three.js portfolio intro. it's a visual and interactive map of all of my current work (including my graphic and product design work, but also things like 3d and silly code projects)

- an interactive language learning game that helps you build your vocabulary through completing quests and speaking in your target language

- and an academic calendar that helps university students improve their grades by tracking their averages, as well as helps them build smarter habits by tracking study hours
